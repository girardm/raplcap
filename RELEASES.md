# Release Notes

## [Unreleased]
### Added
 * [msr] Support for Atom Tremont ("Jacobsville"), Model 0x86
 * [powercap] Support for new "package-X-die-Y" Package zone naming convention in sysfs
 * [powercap] Support for systems with more than 10 packages or dies

### Changed
 * [msr] Updated for the Intel Software Developer's Manual, May 2019 release

### Fixed
 * [msr] Fixed [#6]: Use correct power limit mask (credit: Marc Girard)


## [v0.3.0] - 2018-06-01
### Added
 * MSR implementation support for Atom processors
 * MSR implementation support for Cannon Lake mobile processors
 * Functions for reading energy counters (also added output to rapl-configure binaries)
 * MSR implementation functions to expose time, power, and energy units
 * New -e/--enabled flag for rapl-configure binaries
 * More units tests

### Changed
 * MSR implementation will now only compile on x86 (required for RAPL anyway)
 * Cannot disable zones by setting time window or power limit values to 0 in rapl-configure binaries (use -e/--enabled=0 instead)
 * Improved runtime checking for short term constraint support

### Fixed
 * Some server processors have DRAM energy units distinct from those specified in the power unit register


## [v0.2.0] - 2017-12-11
### Added
 * Some high-level documentation on RAPL and power capping
 * Simple unit and integration tests

### Changed
 * API breakage: Normalized API functions so RAPLCap context is always the first parameter
 * MSR discovery now uses sysfs files instead of parsing /proc/cpuinfo
 * Consistently reset socket count to 0 on destroy or initialization failure
 * Clamping messages reduced from warning to informational
 * Silence error messages when errors are anticipated and handled

### Deprecated
 * The libmsr implementation is no longer a primary RAPLCap backend and may be removed in the future

### Fixed
 * Enable zones even if clamping can't be set (not available for all zones/platforms)
 * Fixed "raplcap_is_zone_supported" in MSR implementation
 * Only operate on short term constraints in powercap implementation if zone supports it


## [v0.1.2] - 2017-11-12
### Added
 * VERSION and SOVERSION to shared object libraries
 * Multiarch support (use GNU standard installation directories)

### Changed
 * Increased minimum CMake version from 2.8 to 2.8.5 to support GNUInstallDirs
 * Updated license to use author as copyright holder
 * Expand man page for rapl-configure binaries
 * Code optimizations

### Fixed
 * Sort packages in raplcap-powercap as sysfs entries may be out of order
 * Minor fixes to some log messages


## [v0.1.1] - 2017-10-02
### Added
 * Added man page for rapl-configure binaries

### Changed
 * Upstream libmsr removed functionality for PP0/PP1 (core and uncore) zones, so we check for functions during build
 * Try to open files as read-only when possible, but no guarantees
 * Build improvements

### Fixed
 * Fixed possible crash with getopt in rapl-configure binaries


## v0.1.0 - 2017-06-09
### Added
 * Initial public release
